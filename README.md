# ReinforcementLearning
Chapter wise implementation &amp; analysis of all the algorithms in RL : An Intoduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto


## Chapter 2

The Notebook Greedy,e-Greedy,UCB,Gradient.ipynb demonstrates the working of following algorithms:
  1. Greedy Algorithm
  2. epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
  3. UCB
  4. Gradient Bandit
  
The notebook also shows the anlysis on the above algorithms with Optimistic Initial Values. Results shows that UCB outperforms all other algorithms in stationary K-armed Bandit problem.
